play-sass
=========

[Sass][sass] asset handling plugin for [Play 2.1][play]. Implemented as [sbt][sbt]
plugin.

Prerequisites
-------------

[Sass][sass] compiler needs to be installed for plugin to work. This means that `sass` executable
needs to be found in path. Sass can be installed by by installing `sass` gem.

	gem install sass

You can verify that `sass` has been installed by following command:

	  % sass -v
		Sass 3.1.16 (Brainy Betty)


Installation
------------

Add following to your projects `project/plugins.sbt`

	addSbtPlugin("net.litola" % "play-sass" % "0.1.3" from "https://raw.github.com/tthraine/play-sass/master/play-sass-0.1.3.jar")

This adds Sass asset compiler to Play project. `*.sass` and `*.scss` files in `app/assets` 
directories will then be automatically compiled to `*.css` files. Files starting with 
`_`-character will be left out from compilation as per Play convention.

Versions

* *0.1.2* [2012-11-16] Minimal windows support by Kalle Bertell. Changed to use
