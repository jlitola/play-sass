play-sass
=========

[Sass][sass] asset handling plugin for [Play 2.x][play]. Implemented as [sbt][sbt]
plugin.

Prerequisites
-------------

[Sass][sass] compiler needs to be installed for plugin to work. This means that `sass` executable
needs to be found in path. Sass can be installed by by installing `sass` gem.

	gem install sass

You can verify that `sass` has been installed by following command:

	% sass -v
	Sass 3.1.16 (Brainy Betty)


Installation
------------

Plugin versions are linked to different Play versions. Each Play-version has some differences in how plugin is enabled. Please select suitable instructions below.

After following the instructions `*.sass` and `*.scss` files in `app/assets` 
directories will then be automatically compiled to `*.css` files. Files starting with 
`_`-character will be left out from compilation as per Play convention.


Play 2.3
--------

Add following to your projects `project/plugins.sbt`

	resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"

	addSbtPlugin("net.litola" % "play-sass" % "0.4.0")

After that you'll need to enable plugin in `build.sbt`. 

	lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala, net.litola.SassPlugin)

If you would like to pass your own command line arguments to Sass call, you can
do it with `.settings` call. For example to use Compass you should append following after previous line.

	.settings(
    	sassOptions := Seq("--compass")
  	)

Play 2.2
--------

Add following to your projects `project/plugins.sbt`

	resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"

	addSbtPlugin("net.litola" % "play-sass" % "0.3.0")

In addition you'll need to add settings to your project. On Play 2.2 this is
done by modifying `build.sbt` and appending following line:

	net.litola.SassPlugin.sassSettings

If you would like to pass your own command line arguments to Sass call, you can
do it by overriding `SassPlugin.sassOptions`. For example to use Compass you can use
following:

	net.litola.SassPlugin.sassSettings
	
	net.litola.SassPlugin.sassOptions := Seq("--compass")


Play 2.0 & 2.1
--------------

Add following to your projects `project/plugins.sbt`: 

	resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"

	addSbtPlugin("net.litola" % "play-sass" % "0.2.0")

For 2.0 use version 0.1.3.

After that you should do following changes to `project/Build.scala`.

	import net.litola.SassPlugin

	val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = SCALA).settings( SassPlugin.sassSettings:_* )


Usage
------

#### Source Files

This plugin expects `.scss` your files to be located in `PROJECT_ROOT/app/assets`, or some sub-folder of that folder.

#### Linking to generated CSS

The `app/assets` directory is mapped to the root path in the running app, so for instance the output of this SCSS file:

`app/assets/test.scss`

can be accessed via this import:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@routes.Assets.at("test.css")">
```

#### Sourcemaps

Source maps are not currently supported, due to the fact that the plugin captures the STDOUT of the SASS process and writes it to a file, rather than generating intermediate files which are then copied to the target location.  Updating the plugin to support sourcemaps is the first piece of work for which this fork was created.


Versions
--------

The newest version only supports Play 2.3. If you need support for older Play versions, please use earlier plugin versions.
